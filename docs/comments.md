## Comments  

Comments are written to clarify things  
that can't be clarified by using proper variable names.  
Comments must be written above the code its related to,  
in lowercase, except then referencing to something.
Comments are not limited by a single line.

Example:  

    # comment above the code
    # more comment above the code
    # 'variable' == 'description' == 'more description'
    code below the comment
    more code below the comment

When dealing with long comments, break the line where it 
would not make a sentance look finished.
