## Comments

Writing comments is optional.
Comments must be written in lowercase, above the code its related to, and written  except then referencing to something.
Comments must be 

and can be written multiple times.

example (newline after this colon is included):

    # comment above the code
    # more comment above the code
    # 'variable' == 'description' == 'more description'
    code below the comment
    more code below the comment
    a template for testing functions.

When dealing with long comments,
break a line where it wouldn't distort the logical continuation, such as conditional statements like 'and', or punctuation marks like ','.
